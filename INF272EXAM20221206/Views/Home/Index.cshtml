        In this exam you will be completing two sections in one exam paper. In the
        paper you will be required to work on AJAX, jQuery, Chart.js and OOP.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the limited time for a supplementary exam, you will not be tested on databases.
        Students have been evaluated on databases on numerous occasions.
        This exam therefore excludes databases and makes use of hardcoded data provided as a class repository.
        Do not edit the details in the repository. You will need to make use of the details to ensure the functionality of this program.
